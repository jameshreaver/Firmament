# About
 
Firmament is an online application to allow the exploration of the night sky and the discovery of all its constellations. It works on desktop and mobile browsers and displays the celestial sphere accurately based on the time, the date and the location.
 
The app offers three main modes:
- **Observatory Mode** allows free exploration of the sky. The constellations are labelled and outlined to be clearly identified.
- **Exploration Mode** involves a step-by-step learning process of the constellation, divided into families. Every constellation is shown with key information and facts about its history and meaning.
- **Challenge Mode** is a way to put the gained knowledge to test by naming as many constellations as possible in the given time (single player mode) or by beating friends at finding constellations in the sky (multiplayer mode).

The app was originally hosted at <https://firmament.space/>.
